# *The Chronicle*
Code for the [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com) project used to detail the canonical world and events of "Project Heroes." This serves as an internal wiki or "Fandom." This repo does not contain any of the information in this world, just the code used to display it.

The Chronicle Bureau is an in-universe organization responsible for preserving an archive of human history and humanity's collective knowledge. The "chronicle" is the colloquial term for this archive, hence the name of this repo.
